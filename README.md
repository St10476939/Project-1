"# Project-1" 
 Using Kotlin in Android Studio, I created a native Android app that makes food recommendations according to the time of day.  The objective was to develop a straightforward but efficient method that makes choosing a meal enjoyable and uncomplicated.  I used Kotlin to implement logic in this way.  I classified the current system time into one of the three lunch times using if statements.  The software then uses this information to dynamically recommend a meal from a list of pre-established lines.  This is how I designed the functionality of the app.  In order to recommend a meal, the app had to ascertain the current time. It needed to identify if it was breakfast, lunch, or dinner and offer enticing menu suggestions.  The end product is a straightforward but effective meal recommendation tool that relieves Hera of the burden of making hurried food decisions.  She can now rely on the app to provide her with dinner suggestions that suit the time of day whenever she's busy.
